A: To indicate if they succeed or fail.
Q: Does pathfinder read input from a file?
A: Your pathfinder program reads from stdin. In the example in A2.txt,
   Linux INPUT REDIRECTION was used to cause the program's stdin to 
   be attached to a file. But your program doesn't know anything about 
   this--it just reads from its stdin.
