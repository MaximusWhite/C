To compile the program, use the following command:
"gcc -o q2 q2.c"
This will produce an executable "q2".
NOTE: In order for the program to work, make sure that the "table" file, from question 1 is in the same folder as "q2". 
Once you run q2 program, it will ask you for the ID and the password. 
After that, if the ID is not found in the table, the program will inform you and ask to enter ID and password again.
If ID is in the table, the program will do necessary action on part of "client side" and "server side" and inform you if the acces was granted or not.
After that, the program will ask you if you want to start over again.
If you type "Y" or "y", the program will start from the beginning. If you type "N" or "n", the program will quit.

The functionality is shown on the screenshot in the report.
